## CodTech_01
### Task No 01 Of CodTech Internship 
### Here i have taken a dataset and performed various Operations
#### Start with a dataset of your choice and perform EDA using libraries like pandas, numpy,
#### and matplotlib or seaborn. Explore the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations,
#### and outliers. Visualize your findings with histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to
#### gain insights into the data.
#### Objective:- As an MCA student, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps you understand the dataset's structure, patterns, and relationships. It aids in identifying missing values, outliers, and correlations between features, which are crucial for data cleaning and feature selection. EDA also enhances your visualization skills, allowing you to interpret data through histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps. These insights guide decision-making and model-building, preparing you for more advanced machine learning techniques and ensuring better data quality for accurate analysis and predictions.
